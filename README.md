# Froala-editor-v2.3
Image caption add on for froala editor v 2.3. Its officially not available in the plugin, I have made some tweeks to customize the plugin and give you a neat caption option available with the latest version of froala editor. To get things started just replace the files (images.js and image_caption.css) with froalas plugin files.
